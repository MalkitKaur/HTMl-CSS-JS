    <p>
        I spin a shade of blue
        I don't know what to do
        But I'll see you in the morning
        Baby, I'm no fool
        Yeah, you don't seem to care
        Quite like you used to do
        But I'll see you in the morning
        Baby, I'm no fool

    <p>
        Ayy, baby, why you been so foolish?<!--this ones great-->
        Don't gotta put me through this
        Laying on the dirt floor
        Missing all the tulips
        Brushing on my cheeks, flying free
        Now I'm locked down
        Still call you my princess
        'Cause I don't wanna stop now
        Grew up in a small town
        Life was always good enough
        All we had was friends sipping pop at the cinema
        Then we took a turn for the worst
        Yelling out our conversations
        Once a month became everyday shit
        Yeah, let's face it
        Got no patience
        Can't erase this
        Alcohol was added, toxifying our relation
        Ship sink can't think
        Water in my ears
        It's hard to end a story we been living in for years
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Verse 3</u></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I spin a shade of blue<!--Rockin' it-->
        I don't know what to do
        But I'll see you in the morning
        Baby, I'm no fool
        Yeah, you don't seem to care
        Quite like you used to do
        But I'll see you in the morning (Ay, no fool)
        Baby, I'm no fool (Ayy)
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Verse 4</u></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Yo, baby can you tell me why I'm blue again?
        You acting like a hooligan
        I do resent
        The way you choosing quick with who you fooling with
        I'm too convinced
        That you just wanted me because I'm cool as shit
        Honda Civic, you crashing it
        Brand new Beamer I'm cruising in
        Listen up
        Why you talk a lot when you don't risk enough? <!--i hope you like it too-->
        The jig is up, now I've been moving on
        We getting into stuff
        She natural
        Only into women with no nip and tuck
        And girl I did a lot for you, so how did I not give a-
        Falling like there's part of the floor gone
        Until I hit the ground and knew I couldn't be more wrong
        I only liked the image I created when we met in the past
        And yeah, I found that sticky note that said we never could last
        We didn't

        <li><u>Verse 5</u></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I spin a shade of blue<!-- here we go again with the same verse-->
        I don't know what to do
        But I'll see you in the morning
        Baby, I'm no fool
        Yeah, you don't seem to care
        Quite like you used to do
        But I'll see you in the morning
        Baby, I'm no fool
