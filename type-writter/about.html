                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <h4>WHERE TECHNOLOGY MEETS NOSTALGIA</h4>
                    <p>In the early 1900s, a visionary young woman named Malkit Kaur saw the potential of the rapidly growing typewriter industry and decided to start her 
                        own typewriter manufacturing company. With her keen eye for design and passion for innovation, Malkit set out to create a company that would produce the most 
                        advanced and high-quality typewriters on the market.</P>
                        
                        <P>Malkit Imperials, as the company came to be known, quickly gained a reputation for excellence. Each of its typewriters was crafted with precision and care, 
                        with a focus on durability and reliability. Malkit herself was a tireless inventor, constantly experimenting with new mechanisms and features to make her machines 
                        faster, more efficient, and more user-friendly.</P>
                        <P>As the company grew, Malkit Imperials expanded its operations to other parts of the world, opening factories and offices in major cities across the globe. Its 
                        machines became popular with writers, journalists, and business people alike, and the company's name became synonymous with quality and innovation.
                        In the 1960s, Malkit Imperials was at the forefront of the computer revolution, developing some of the earliest electronic typewriters and other computer-related 
                        technologies. Malkit herself remained involved in the company's operations well into her later years, always striving to stay ahead of the curve in terms of technology 
                        and design.</P>
                        <P>Today, Malkit Imperials is a beloved icon of the typewriter industry, with collectors and enthusiasts around the world cherishing its vintage machines for their beauty, 
                        craftsmanship, and historical significance. While the company no longer produces typewriters, its legacy lives on, inspiring generations of inventors and entrepreneurs to 
                        pursue excellence and innovation in everything they do.</p>
